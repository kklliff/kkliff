 9. Inject 5-20 ml of air through the feeding tube while auscultating the left upper abdomen while listening to gurgling, <br>
 whoosing   and bubbling sound. If you hear gurgling, whoosing and bubbling sound we are now <br> sure that the tube is patent. </th>

 10. Aspirate all the stomach contents and measure the amount prior to administeringthe feeding.</th>
<th><p style="text-align:left"> This is done to evaluate the absorption of the last feeding. If >50ml of undigested formula is withdrawn  in adults and >10 ml in infants and its color is somewhat like yellow. <br> Reinstill the gastric contents into the stomach. Removal of contents disturbs the clients electrolyte balance. If 50 ml or more of undigested formula is withdrawn <br>  in adults and  10 ml < in infants check with the nurse incharge before proceeding. <br> The precise amount is usually determined bythe Physician’s order or by Policy of the agency. </th>
